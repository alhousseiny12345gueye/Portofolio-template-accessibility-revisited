# Portofolio-template-accessibility-revisited

###This work is a prototype of an accessible version of a portfolio template website. 
This is the link to the original university website hamidou-barry.com. 

The original website is like most templates of websites we can find online. They are aesthetic. However, they are not very functional accessibility wise. 
Mostly because of the wrong use of HTML attribute. Itâ€™s makes it nearly impossible for screen readers to navigate the page properly.

I used a google chrome extension as automated way of evaluation. It pointed out contrast issues, missing alt text for images and missing link description.

Then I manually investigated the webpage to find out that all the buttons of the pages were using the wrong labels therefore a screen reader could not read them as button. Wrong use of headings attributes, missing label for the form, no skip to content option and some more.

So I made this prototype trying to fix the accessibility issues to achieve a level AA accessibility compliance.
